# Looping-Pendulum-simulation
The looping pendulum is a simple physics toy that shows the surprising strength of frictional force, between a string and an axle, that can stop a heavy object from falling down. The string's two ends are connected to the heavy object and a light mass, and is hung over an axle/pulley and allowed to move. If the light mass is released at an angle, then it may loop. 

Newton's Laws of motion are used to calculate the masses' motion, together with the Capstan equation (for friction between the string and axle), and total string length conservation equation. 
The crux of this problem is knowing whether the heavy mass, M, stops or slides. A rare case is possible where M stops, but then the string tension decreases sufficienty, for M to slide before stopping again. 
Of course, m may just swing like a pendulum without looping, until M drops. 

Treats M, m as point masses so does not account for real life end-case where the non-point mass, e.g. a brass 50g weight, touches the axle.
